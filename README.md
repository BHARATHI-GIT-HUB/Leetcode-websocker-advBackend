## üîç Understanding LeetCode Backend Processes

When you submit a solution on LeetCode, the platform engages in a continuous polling process to the backend server. This means it repeatedly checks for a response regarding the status of your submission. Essentially, LeetCode keeps asking the server, "Are we there yet?" until the task is completed.

Once the backend processing is done, the response is then relayed to the frontend interface. This backend-to-frontend communication loop ensures that users receive timely updates on the status of their submissions. However, this traditional approach of polling can sometimes lead to inefficiencies and unnecessary strain on the server.

## Optimizing LeetCode Backend Processes

An alternative solution, involves implementing WebSocket connections. Unlike polling, WebSocket allows for real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and client. With WebSocket, the server can push updates to the client as soon as they are available, eliminating the need for continuous polling.

By adopting WebSocket technology, platforms like LeetCode can enhance user experience by providing faster and more responsive feedback on submission statuses. This innovative approach aligns with the industry's pursuit of efficient and scalable backend solutions.
